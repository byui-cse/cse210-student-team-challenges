# Final Project

## Getting Started
---
We need python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your computer to make this program work. 
To run the program open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by 
running the following command.
```
(windows: py3 #Game name, (Mac: Python 3 #Game name)) 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE 
and open the project folder. Select the main module inside the <!-- Game name --> folder and 
click the "run" icon.
